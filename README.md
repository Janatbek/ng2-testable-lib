# ng2-testable-lib

Tutorial on building a testable **Angular2** library.

This project takes the developer through the process of building a library for Angular2. The library will be generated with the [generator-angular2-library](https://github.com/jvandemo/generator-angular2-library) which currently does not provide a test environment. 

It will be explained how to configure the project to run tests with **Karma** and **Jasmine**.
